## port scan

This chapter will demonstrate how to develop a basic port scanner through Python's network connection. Our design idea is to use socket over and over again to connect the new value of the combination of ip and port, for the sake of quick completion It first needs to introduce a little new concept, for loop:

>>>
>>> for port in range(1000,1024):
...   print "[+] The port is: "+str(port)
...
[+] The port is: 1000
[+] The port is: 1001
[+] The port is: 1002
[+] The port is: 1003
[+] The port is: 1004
[+] The port is: 1005
[+] The port is: 1006
[+] The port is: 1007
[+] The port is: 1008
[+] The port is: 1009
[+] The port is: 1010
[+] The port is: 1011
[+] The port is: 1012
[+] The port is: 1013
[+] The port is: 1014
[+] The port is: 1015
[+] The port is: 1016
[+] The port is: 1017
[+] The port is: 1018
[+] The port is: 1019
[+] The port is: 1020
[+] The port is: 1021
[+] The port is: 1022
[+] The port is: 1023
Note that the above paragraph of code in the body of indentation, usually two spaces or a tab key, but this does not matter, as long as your entire code has been able to. The short port scanner core code I wrote was written in the Output Block section of the code above and then a socket connection was established. The following code demonstrates how to use the built-in socket module to establish a socket connection:

>>>
>>> import socket
>>>
>>> s = socket.socket()
>>> s.connect(('127.0.0.1s', 22))
>>> s.send('Primal Security \n')
17
>>> banner = s.recv(1024)
>>> print banner
OpenSSH
The above example: We first import this socket module and call connect () function to connect the specified IP address and port. It will establish a TCP connection (SYN / SYN-ACK / ACK) and we send a real data to the server through the send () function, then use recv () to print out the contents of the response. Now teach you how to fault-tolerant socket for the connection can not be opened:

>>>
>>> s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 23))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "<string>", line 1, in connect
socket.error: (111, 'Connection refused')
There are several ways to deal with the above error, here we use the simplest way: Use the "try / except" loop to handle the error:

>>>
>>> try:
...   s.connect(('127.0.0.1', 23))
... except: pass
...
>>>
Now there will be no mistakes, and his party is a very simple code allows your program to continue to work ^ _ ^. Now let's use the knowledge we learned before to write a simple port scanner using the for loop:

>>>
>>> for port in range(20,25):
...   try:
...    print "[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:"+str(port)
...     s.connect(('127.0.0.1', port))
...     s.send('Primal Security \n')    
...     banner = s.recv(1024)
...     if banner:
...       print "[+] Port "+str(port)+" open: "+banner
...     s.close()
...   except: pass
...
17
[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:20
[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:21
[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:22
[+] Port 22 open: OpenSSH
[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:23
[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:24
[+] Attempting to connect to 127.0.0.1:25
Above, we demonstrated the use of a "try / except" loop to deal with port shutdown errors when a socket was connected, and we also demonstrated how to use the "if" statement to print the ports that can be successfully connected. Below we will create a scanner where we scan the specified port, where the port number, we use an array to store, and then traverse this array:

>>>
>>> ports = [22, 445, 80, 443, 3389]
>>> for port in ports:
...   print port
...
22
445
80
443
3389
>>>
If we want to scan multiple hosts at once, we can use a for loop nesting. The outermost is the host ip, and then the for loop is the port. Here's a basic example that shows how to build a simple scanner by looping nested:

>>>
>>> hosts = ['127.0.0.1', '192.168.1.5', '10.0.0.1']
>>>
>>> ports = [22, 445, 80, 443, 3389]
>>>
>>> for host in hosts:
...   for port in ports:
...     try:
...        print "[+] Connecting to "+host+":"+str(port)
...        s.connect((host, port))
...        s.send('Primal Security \n')
...        banner = s.recv(1024)
...        if banner:
...          print "[+] Port "+str(port)+" open: "+banner
...        s.close()
...     except:pass
...
[+] Connecting to 127.0.0.1:22
[+] Port 22 open: OpenSSH
[+] Connecting to 127.0.0.1:445
[+] Connecting to 127.0.0.1:80
[+] Connecting to 127.0.0.1:443
[+] Connecting to 127.0.0.1:3389
[+] Connecting to 192.168.1.5:22
[+] Connecting to 192.168.1.5:445
[+] Connecting to 192.168.1.5:80
[+] Connecting to 192.168.1.5:443
[+] Connecting to 192.168.1.5:3389
[+] Connecting to 10.0.0.1:22
[+] Connecting to 10.0.0.1:445
[+] Connecting to 10.0.0.1:80
[+] Connecting to 10.0.0.1:443
[+] Connecting to 10.0.0.1:3389
As you can see, it traverses all the values ​​in the hosts array once through the ports array, waiting for hosts [0] to scan hosts [1] after the scan is done, and so on. In this example, you can also modify the code inside, it only shows that you can open the port.

At the end of the day, you'll probably find Nmap the best, but we'll continue to refine this example later in the article. We can take a moment to learn some of the other functionalities of the socket module. We can use "dir (socket)" To learn more, of course, 'help ()'.
